# 4x4-sudoku
I first create a 4x4 matrix filled with 0. Than I use recursive backtracking to fill the matrix according to the 3 rules of sudoku. Finally the matrix is used to render the sudoku board in pygame
the player can select a cell by moving his mouse, and clicking....the selected cell will be highlighted in green.
I creted a copy of the grid named 'memo', I intended to check the player filled cells to the values in memo, but couldnt get it to work
