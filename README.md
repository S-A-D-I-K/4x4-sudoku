# 4x4-sudoku

I first create a 4x4 matrix filled with 0.

Than I use recursive backtracking to fill the matrix according to the 3 rules of sudoku.

After that the matrix is used to render the sudoku board in pygame

the player can select a cell by moving his mouse and clicking.The selected cell will be highlighted in green.

Player can Fill number using keyboard

If the player filled number is wrong, the cell will be highlighted in red

Finally, when all cells are filled, display "YOU WIN!"

And that is my first fully functional Python game
